# ReatEstatePrediction

The project predicts the pricing of houses in Bangalore City. To run the model, a simple website is also created. Run the server.py file to start the server, go to the website and try the model. To predict the prices, the project considers parameters like total square feet, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and location. Linear Regression, Lasso and Decision tree were used to predict and were checked for different parameters for each one of them. Logistic regression gave the highest accuracy.
